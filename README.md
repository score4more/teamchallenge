# Full Stack Code Challenge: PDF Parser

## Overview
This is a code challenge for full-stack developers. The challenge involves building a PDF parsing feature with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.

## Challenge Description
Create a feature that allows users to:
1. Upload a PDF file through a web interface
2. Parse the PDF content on the backend into chunks/sections:
   - Each PDF should be split into logical sections (e.g., by pages or chapters)
   - Store basic metadata (upload date, title, total pages) with the PDF
3. Store the parsed content in a database (PDF and its chunks)
4. Display the parsed content in a structured way on the frontend:
   - A list view showing available PDFs with their metadata
   - A detail view showing:
     - PDF metadata
     - A paginated list of chunks/sections
     - The ability to search through chunks

Note: Build as far as you get in a few hours, focus on the parts you consider most important to show your skills and best practices.
If you run out of time, feel free to add your thoughts and ideas as comments or notes.
